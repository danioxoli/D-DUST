- [feature_selection.ipynb](https://github.com/opengeolab/D-DUST/blob/thesis_MB/notebooks/feature_selection.ipynb): Notebook used to evaluate feature selection results for each algorithm/method. It import [test_grid.gpkg](https://github.com/opengeolab/D-DUST/blob/thesis_MB/notebooks/grids/test_grid.gpkg) as dataset.
- [feature_selection_filtered.ipynb](https://github.com/opengeolab/D-DUST/blob/thesis_MB/notebooks/feature_selection_filtered.ipynb): Notebook used to evaluate feature selection results for each algorithm/method. Differently from the previuous one, this import [test_grid_filtered.gpkg](https://github.com/opengeolab/D-DUST/blob/thesis_MB/notebooks/grids/test_grid.gpkg) and the feature selection take in consideration only **no sensor** variables;
- [Results.ipynb](https://github.com/opengeolab/D-DUST/blob/thesis_MB/notebooks/Results.ipynb): This notebook collect the results obtained by feature selection (collected in .csv files in the folder [results](https://github.com/opengeolab/D-DUST/tree/thesis_MB/notebooks/results));
